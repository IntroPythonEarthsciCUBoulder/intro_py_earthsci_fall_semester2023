    "# Background: Raster Bands and NDVI\n",
    "In this assignment you will investigate how different topographic metrics correspond to vegetation.  To do so, we will calculate the **normalized difference vegetation index** (**NDVI**) in an area around Boulder.  Plant leaves do not absorb light in the near-infrared part (NIR)  of the electromagnetic spectrum.  In contrast [chlorophyll is most effecient at capturing red light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetically_active_radiation).  This means if you were to look at the radiation signature of an area with lots of plants, it would be emititng lots of NIR and little red light.   From this idea we get [NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{NDVI}=\\frac{(\\text{NIR}-\\text{Red})}{(\\text{NIR}+\\text{Red})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "[Landsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat_program) is a series of satellites that have been circling the earth since the early 70s.  The sensors on the Landsat sattelites collect (among other things) grids of the ammount of Blue, Green, and Red light (what your phone camera collects!) and NIR radiation reflected from the surface of the Earth.  We call each set of the spectrum captured a \"band\" of data.  So the \"blue band\" of a Landsat gird is grid of numbers that reflects the ammount of blue light reflected at each point on the surface.  We can use this to calculate NDVI for every cell of a Landsat grid.  Each cell of a Ldndsat is like a pixel in a photograph, but it corresponds to a sectio of the surface of the earth.\n",

    "# How Computers Represent Photographs\n",
    "An photograph is a recording of light reflected off something (typically refered to as a scene).  When a human observes something visually, it is light reflected off objects that activates specialized cells in the retina.  Photographs work the same way, using a variety of technologies to substitute for the cells of the retina.  Traditional film photography uses a film full of light-sensitive silver salt crystal, part of which becomes metallic silver when exposed to light.  Digital photography uses an array of photosensitive circuits that record the ammount of light.  In either case, what you are left with is (typically but not necessarily) a rectangle that represents the amount of light reflected from a captured scene.\n",

Below is a sample raster repreented in python as a list of lists of integers.  The first list is the upper row of pixels in our image.  The top left pixel has a value of 255, meaning very bright.  The bottom right has a value of 60, rather dark. "

    "## Color photography\n",
    "The sensors (silver salt or digitial circuit) record the *ammount* of light that hit them, not necessarily the *color* of light.  So how do we get color images?  Humans see color because specific types of cells in the retina are sensitive to specific wavelengths of light.  Humans are sensitive to red, green, and blue light (see below).\n",
    "![human color sensitivity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/1416_Color_Sensitivity.svg)\n",
    "Our eyes take in the ammount of red, green, and blue light in what we see, and construct color based on that.  We can mimic that with a digital image by recording the ammount of red, green, and blue light.  This can be done by filtering out different types of light, but you can think of a digital camera as, like an eye, having three different types of sensors.  When a computer displays an image, rather than each pixel representing a certain ammount of light, like in our example above, each \"pixel\" is three lights, one red, one green, and one blue.  Each light as a brightness that corresponds to the relative ammount of that color light in that part of the scene.  Put your phone screen under a microscope sometime, you'll see that it's actually made up of a bunch of red, green,. and blue lights!\n",
    "### Color rasters\n",
    "But how do we store this on a computer?  Whereas before, we had a list of lists, or an array where each value was the ammount of light reflected from a scene, instead we could have each value be a tuple contaning the ammount of red, green, and blue light!"
